SECTION "Shadow OAM", WRAM0, ALIGN[8]
; Reserve page-aligned space for a Shadow OAM buffer, to which we can safely write OAM data at any time, 
;  and then use our OAM DMA routine to copy it quickly to OAMRAM when desired. OAM DMA can only operate
;  on a block of data that starts at a page boundary, which is why we use ALIGN[8].
wShadowOAM:
    ds OAM_COUNT * 4


SECTION "OAM DMA Routine", ROMX
; Initiate OAM DMA and then wait until the operation is complete, then return
; @param A High byte of the source data to DMA to OAM

SECTION "Tile Data", ROMX
; Our tile data in 2bpp planar format (https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Tile_Data.html)
