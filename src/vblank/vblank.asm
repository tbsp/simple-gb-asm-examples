; The VBlank vector is where execution is passed when the VBlank interrupt fires
SECTION "VBlank Vector", ROM0[$40]
; We only have 8 bytes here, so push all the registers to the stack and jump to the rest of the handler
; Note: Since the VBlank handler used here only affects A and F, we don't have to push/pop BC, DE, and HL,
;  but it's done here for demonstration purposes.
VBlank:
    push af             ; Push AF, BC, DE, and HL to the stack
    push bc
    push de
    push hl
    jp VBlankHandler    ; Jump to the rest of the handler


; The rest of the handler is contained in ROM0 to ensure it's always accessible without banking
